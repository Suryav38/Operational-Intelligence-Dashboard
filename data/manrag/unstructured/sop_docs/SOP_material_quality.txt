Document ID: SOP-MAT-QUAL-002
Revision: 1.3
Owner: Quality Assurance
Effective Date: 2023-06-15

1. Purpose
To define the standard response when material quality issues are suspected or confirmed,
in order to protect product quality and prevent excessive scrap.

2. Scope
Applies to all incoming raw materials used on Lines L1, L2, and L3.

3. Responsibilities
- Operators: Identify and report visible defects, jams, or abnormal behavior linked to material.
- Quality Technicians: Inspect suspect material, perform checks, and make disposition decisions.
- Purchasing: Coordinate with suppliers on quality concerns and corrective actions.

4. Triggers for Material Quality Review
- Sudden increase in scrap rate associated with a specific supplier or batch.
- Repeated jams or feeding issues with the same material lot.
- Visual defects (surface damage, incorrect dimensions, contamination).

5. Procedure
5.1 Immediate Actions
    a. Stop production on the affected line if safety or severe quality risk is present.
    b. Isolate the suspect material batch and label it as "ON HOLD".
    c. Record batch ID, supplier, and time of issue in the shift report.

5.2 Inspection
    a. Perform visual inspection and basic measurements on suspect material.
    b. Compare against approved specifications and reference samples.
    c. Document findings and, if required, collect photo evidence.

5.3 Disposition
    a. If material is within spec, release for controlled trial run with close monitoring.
    b. If material is out of spec, hold the batch and escalate to Quality and Purchasing.
    c. Consider switching to an alternate approved supplier or batch if available.

6. Documentation
- All material issues must be logged in the quality system with batch ID and supplier.
- Supplier performance metrics are updated monthly based on number and severity of issues.

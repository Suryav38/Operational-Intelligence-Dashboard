Document Title: SOP - Mechanical Alignment for M-Series Machines
Document ID: SOP-MECH-ALIGN-001
Revision: 2.0
Owner: Maintenance Engineering
Effective Date: 2023-09-01

1. Purpose
This procedure defines the standard method for inspecting and correcting mechanical alignment
on M-series machines to minimize vibration, scrap, and unplanned downtime.

2. Scope
Applies to all M-series machines operating on Lines L1, L2, and L3.

3. Responsibilities
- Maintenance Technicians: Perform alignment inspections and adjustments.
- Line Supervisors: Schedule planned alignment checks and verify completion.
- Operators: Report abnormal noise, vibration, or recurring jams.

4. Required PPE
- Safety glasses
- Safety shoes
- Cut-resistant gloves
- Hearing protection (in high-noise areas)

5. Procedure
5.1 Lockout/Tagout
    a. Stop the machine and follow site lockout/tagout procedures.
    b. Verify zero energy state before proceeding.

5.2 Inspection
    a. Inspect belts, pulleys, couplings, and mounting points for visible wear or misalignment.
    b. Check for loose fasteners, cracked mounts, or abnormal wear patterns.

5.3 Alignment
    a. Use approved alignment tools to verify shaft and belt alignment.
    b. Adjust as necessary until alignment is within specified tolerances.
    c. Tighten all mounting bolts to specified torque.

5.4 Verification
    a. Remove lockout/tagout and restart the machine.
    b. Run a short test batch and monitor vibration, noise, and scrap levels.
    c. If abnormal conditions persist, escalate to the Maintenance Supervisor.

6. Documentation
- Record all alignment activities, measurements, and replaced components in the maintenance system.
- Tag any components that must be monitored in future inspections.

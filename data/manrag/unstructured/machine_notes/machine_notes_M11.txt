Machine: M11
Line: L1
Type: Assembler

Operator Notes (High Attention Asset):
This machine has a known history of vibration and alignment issues, especially during extended production runs
and immediately after mechanical changeovers.

Common Observations:
- Increased noise and vibration at higher speeds.
- Minor jams at the infeed section that can escalate if not cleared promptly.
- Gradual rise in scrap rate (surface defects, dimension out of spec) when alignment drifts.

Operating Guidelines:
- Perform a quick vibration and noise check at the start of each shift.
- Stop and inspect if minor stoppages occur more than 3 times within a 2-hour window.
- Document all abnormal events in the shift log, even if resolved quickly.

Escalation:
- If unplanned downtime exceeds 60 minutes in a shift, notify maintenance immediately.
- If repeated alignment issues occur in the same week, request a full mechanical inspection.

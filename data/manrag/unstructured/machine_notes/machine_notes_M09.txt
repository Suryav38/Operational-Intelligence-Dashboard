Operator Notes:
This asset generally runs reliably under standard operating conditions.
Most issues are related to routine wear, minor jams, or sensor calibration.

Operating Guidelines:
- Follow the standard startup checklist, including safety and interlock checks.
- Keep the work area clear of excess material, tools, and debris.
- Record any recurring stoppages, product defects, or unusual noise patterns in the shift report.

Escalation:
- If the same stoppage reason appears more than twice in a shift, log a maintenance request.
- If product quality concerns are observed, hold suspect pallets and notify quality.

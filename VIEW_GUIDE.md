# View guide: what each page shows and how the numbers are calculated

There are three pages, and they form one planning workflow:

| Page | Question |
|---|---|
| **Demand outlook** (opens first) | What is requested for 2027, how did it change between the 2026Q3 and 2027 plans, and how much of it will actually run? |
| **Fab performance** | What did the line deliver in 2026Q4 to date? These are the operating conditions every scenario starts from. |
| **Capacity scenario planning** | Can we accept extra wafers, what happens to the programs sharing the tools, and what is the cheapest response to the 2027 plan? |

All data is synthetic. The model is a two-fab development network: Fab A has EUV, Fab B is DUV only. It runs five established programs.

The grey bar at the top holds two settings: **Fab** (Both, Fab A or Fab B) and **Planning limit** (default 85% loading). The pages have no headline sentences. Each chart heading states what is being compared and over what period.

## 1. Demand outlook

The 2027 plan is compared against **today**: the 2026Q4 rate (the quarter in progress).

| Element | How it is calculated |
|---|---|
| KPI tiles | 2026Q3 actual starts; the 2026Q4 forecast; 2027Q4 requested and expected starts; request growth from 2026Q4 to 2027Q4; and the backtest error for the raw request vs. the adjusted request. |
| Requested vs. actual wafer starts | Quarterly *average weekly* starts. **Requested** (grey) runs through 2026Q4, then continues as the 2027 plan request (blue). **Starts** (black) are actuals to 2026Q3, then the 2026Q4 forecast, then 2027 expected starts (request × realization factor, hollow markers). |
| 2026Q4 forecast | Q4 is in progress. For each fab and program, Q4 = the Q3 value × (1 + the average quarter-on-quarter change over the last four quarters), done separately for requests and for starts. It never enters the fit. |
| Demand bridge | The 2026Q4 rate, plus each program's change, gives the 2027 average. |
| Wafer starts by program and quarter | Each cell shows the 2027 value and its change against 2026Q4. Shading: blue for increases and red for decreases, darker for bigger changes (±3%, 10% and 25% bands). |
| Requested vs. actual by program | One chart per program, covering 2024–2027. |
| 2027 mix | Stacked by program, family or fab. |
| Actual vs. requested (realization factor) | `b = Σ(requested × actual) ÷ Σ(requested²)` for each program, fitted on 2024Q1–2026Q3. **Expected = requested × b.** The backtest refits on data up to 2025Q4 and measures MAPE on 2026Q1–Q3: about 10% for the raw request against about 2% for request × b. |
| Priorities and milestones | Each program's priority, milestone, date and protected flag, with its 2026Q4 rate, 2027 average and change. |

The 2027 requests are stored on the same basis as historical requests (run rate ÷ b). That's why there is no artificial step at the year boundary: requests go 2,942 → 2,994 → 3,130 from 2026Q3 to 2027Q1.

## 2. Fab performance: 2026Q4 to date (28 Sep – 25 Oct 2026, simulated)

The four weeks after the stored history come from rerunning the same fab simulation (seed 42) for 56 weeks instead of 52. Lots, process times and tool states use per-lot and per-tool random streams, so the first 52 weeks reproduce the stored history exactly. The script checks this before writing anything. Only the new weeks are saved, to the `*_q4` tables (`code/simulate_q4_to_date.py`).

| Element | Calculation |
|---|---|
| Progress tiles | Weeks completed out of 13; wafers started so far as a share of the quarter total (13 × the weekly request); average starts per week as a share of the requested weekly *rate*. |
| Starts vs. completions vs. Q4 request | Weekly wafers against the 2026Q4 requested rate |
| WIP and cycle time | WIP at each week end; the average cycle time of lots completed that week |
| Cycle time (p90), line yield | Full-flow lots completed in the window; yield = wafers out ÷ wafers in |
| Tool loading vs. planning limit | Productive hours ÷ (calendar − downtime − engineering). The label shows queue hours per visit. |
| Availability: measured vs. assumed | Measured (productive + standby) ÷ calendar, against the planning value of 1 − PM − unscheduled downtime − engineering |
| Starts by program vs. Q4 plan | Average weekly starts ÷ Q4 requested starts |
| Capacity model vs. lot simulation | 2026Q3 starts run through the capacity formula, compared with the simulated loading. 18 of 19 tool groups agree within ±3 points. Fab B furnace is the exception, because partially filled batches still take a full 6-hour run. |

**Fab assistant: tool logbook and events.** At the bottom of the page you ask in plain English, for example:
- "What problems did the deposition tools at Fab A have in Q4, and how many hours were lost?"
- "Which tools went down most often?"

The assistant:
1. retrieves the matching weekly equipment reviews, using keyword or keyword + embedding search;
2. can run read-only SQL on `tool_events_q4` (one row per unscheduled-down event: tool ID, start, hours, cause, action) and on the other tables;
3. answers with a citation on every paragraph. Numbers must come from a cited source, and a failed draft gets one repair turn.

`code/make_tool_logs.py` writes the reviews and the event table from the simulated tool states (seed 42). The event hours add up to the simulated unscheduled downtime for every fab, week and tool group. Like the rest of the data, it is synthetic.
